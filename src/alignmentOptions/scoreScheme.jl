```julia
ScoreScheme(; match_score=0.0, mismatch_score=0.5,extension_score=0.1,edge_ext_begin=true,edge_ext_end=true,kmerlength=21)
```

A struct for storing scoring parameters used for sequence alignment. Uses a keyword constructor. 

# Fields
- `match_score::Float64`: Score (typically â‰¤ 0) awarded for matching nucleotide. Lower is better.
- `mismatch_score::Float64`: Penalty for nucleotide mismatches. Higher values penalize substitutions more strongly.
- `extension_score::Float64`: Cost to extend a gap (indel). Affects how gaps are penalized during alignment.

- `edge_ext_begin::Bool`: If `true`, allows gaps to be extended at the **beginning** of sequences.
- `edge_ext_end::Bool`: If `true`, allows gaps to be extended at the **end** of sequences.

- `kmerlength::Int64`: Length of k-mers used for seeding alignments (if applicable). Ignored if no seeding is used.

# Description
`ScoreScheme` defines how matches, mismatches, and gaps are scored during nucleotide-level sequence alignment. 

This struct is typically passed to functions like `seed_chain_align` or `msa_codon_align`.

# example
```julia
score_params = ScoreScheme(extension_score = 0.3, mismatch_score = 0.7) # (everything else will be keept at default values)
```

"""
    std_codon_scoring()

Return a standard codon-aware `ScoreScheme` for alignment.

# Returns
- `ScoreScheme`: Default scoring parameters for codon alignment.

# Parameters
- Match score: `0.0`
- Mismatch score: `0.3`
- Gap extension score: `0.1`
- Allow extension at sequence ends: `true` (both ends)
- K-mer length for seeding: `21`

Use this as a default `ScoreScheme` for codon-preserving alignments.
